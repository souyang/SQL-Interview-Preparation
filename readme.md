# SQL Technical Interview Preparation
This repository contains solutions to SQL Questions which have been attempted on [StrataScratch](https://www.stratascratch.com) and other sites to strengthen my ability in tackling complex logic when tackling SQL technical interviews.

The practice schedule consists of tackling at least 1 *easy*, *medium*, and *hard* questions.
